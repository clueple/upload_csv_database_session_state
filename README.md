Code snippet on how to update a database in csv format with streamlit session without the local path

This is the code example on updating a database, sitting locally in csv format, without knowing the local path of the csv file.
If you want to enable users to update a record in on-going fashion,
this code snippet maybe a good fit for you.

For me, this code is the foundation of building my online accounting app.

This is a good entry point for a data webapp.

Have fun.
